<p class="description">Avatars are found throughout Riipen design with uses in everything from tables to name tags.</p>

## Image avatars

Image avatars can be created by passing the standard img prop `src` into the component.

## Letter avatars

Avatars containing simple characters can be created by passing your string as `children`.
