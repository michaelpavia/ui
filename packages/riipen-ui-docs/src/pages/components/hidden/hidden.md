# Hidden

<p class="description">Quickly and responsively toggle the visibility value of components.</p>

All elements are visible unless they are explicitly hidden. To ease integration with Riipen UI's responsive breakpoints, this component can be used to hide any content.

## How it works

Hidden works with a range of breakpoints e.g. xs or md, and a direction e.g. up or down.
